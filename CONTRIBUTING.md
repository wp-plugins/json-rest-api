# Contributing
Thanks for considering contributing to the project. Unfortunately, GSoC rules
state that I have to write basically all of the code.

If you do have code you'd like to contribute new features in the form of pull
requests, feel free to file them and I'll take a look after GSoC is complete.

That said, I'd be happy to get bug reports and feature requests on the GSoC
Trac! Feel free to report to your heart's content!
