# Changelog

## 0.2

	permissions ([#311][])

	with WP Query syntax ([#266][])

## 0.0.4
- Hyperlinks now available in most constructs under the 'meta' key. At the
	moment, the only thing under this key is 'links', but more will come
	eventually. (Try browsing with a browser tool like JSONView; you should be
	able to view all content just by clicking the links.)
- Accessing / now gives an index which briefly describes the API and gives
	links to more (also added the HIDDEN_ENDPOINT constant to hide from this).
- Post collections now contain a summary of the post, with the full post
	available via the single post call. (prepare_post() has fields split into
	post and post-extended)
- Post entities have dropped post_ prefixes, and custom_fields has changed to
	post_meta.
- Now supports JSONP callback via the _jsonp argument. This can be disabled
	separately to the API itself, as it's only needed for
	cross-origin requests.
- Internal: No longer extends the XMLRPC class. All relevant pieces have been
	copied over. Further work still needs to be done on this, but it's a start.

## 0.0.3:
 - Now accepts JSON bodies if an endpoint is marked with ACCEPT_JSON
